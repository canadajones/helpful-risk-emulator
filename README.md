# helpful-risk-emulator
Discord bot that simulates a map, countries and armies

It is basically a Risk-like game simulator for Discord. 

The bot is responsible for nearly completely automating functions in 1780 which previously fell to Trap

1) The bot will automate all military aspects including army creation, battles, etc.

2) The bot will allow us to simulate a relatively complex economic system as compared to other Trap Games.

3) The bot will be responsible for rendering a map after each turn and recording any territorial exchanges made in the course of the game.

To summarize, the bot will perform all duties formerly vested in Trap.
